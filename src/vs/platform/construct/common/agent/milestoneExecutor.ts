/**
 * milestoneExecutor -- Phase 5.5 (Fix 1) extracted helper.
 *
 * The milestone-iteration + pause/resume logic for runWithApprovedPlan(),
 * extracted as a pure-ish generator function that takes its collaborators
 * as parameters. This makes the core feature testable without instantiating
 * AgentLoopService (which has 22 injected dependencies).
 *
 * The helper takes:
 *   - approvedPlan: the user-approved plan with milestones, steps, pause mode
 *   - executeSubTask: a caller-provided async generator that runs ONE
 *     milestone's worth of LLM + tool work. In production this is
 *     AgentLoopService._executeRounds(); in tests it's a stub that yields
 *     controlled events.
 *   - runVerification: a caller-provided async generator that runs the
 *     harness verification check. In production this is
 *     AgentLoopService.runVerification(); in tests it's a stub.
 *   - awaitResume: a caller-provided async function that resolves when the
 *     user calls resumeFromMilestone() or skipCurrentMilestone(). In
 *     production this awaits the _milestoneResumeResolver promise; in tests
 *     it can be a controllable promise.
 *   - signal: optional AbortSignal.
 *
 * The helper yields the same AgentLoopEvent types that runWithApprovedPlan()
 * yields, including the four milestone events (milestone_reached, milestone_paused,
 * milestone_resumed, milestone_completed) that were previously declared but
 * never emitted.
 *
 * The helper does NOT do: snapshot creation, file watcher start, memory
 * storage, _isRunning toggling, or _executionState management beyond
 * PausedAtMilestone. Those remain the caller's responsibility.
 *
 * Pause rules:
 *   - "every_milestone" mode: pause at every milestone (after verification)
 *   - "major_milestone" mode: pause only at milestones that involve major
 *     operations (file creation/deletion, shell commands, config file edits),
 *     or milestones already flagged as isMajor by the planner
 *   - "selective" mode: pause only at milestones in selectedMilestoneIds
 *   - "full_auto" / undefined: no user-selected pauses
 *   - Verification failure ALWAYS triggers a pause (regardless of mode) so
 *     the user can fix the issue and then resume to continue.
