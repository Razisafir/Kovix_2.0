## Previous Session Claims vs Reality

| Claim | Reality | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Phases 1-8 pushed to GitHub | CONFIRMED - on origin/main at 2054a23c | ✅ TRUE |
| README.md updated | CONFIRMED - shows Kovix v1.0.0-beta | ✅ TRUE |
| INSTALL.md created | CONFIRMED - exists on GitHub main | ✅ TRUE |
| CHANGELOG.md updated | CONFIRMED - v1.0.0-beta section exists | ✅ TRUE |
| KOVIX_LICENSE.txt exists | CONFIRMED - renamed from CONSTRUCT_LICENSE.txt | ✅ TRUE |
| TEST_RESULTS.md exists | CONFIRMED - on GitHub main | ✅ TRUE |
| License changed from MIT | CONFIRMED - product.json shows "Proprietary", package.json shows "SEE LICENSE IN KOVIX_LICENSE.txt" | ✅ TRUE |
| GitHub release created | CONFIRMED - v1.0.0-beta-final release exists | ✅ TRUE |
| 8 commits total (user claim) | FALSE - 20+ commits exist, all Phase 1-10 work is committed | ❌ INCORRECT |

## CONSTRUCT Source Layer

### File Counts
- src/vs/workbench/contrib/construct/: **38** TypeScript files
- src/vs/platform/construct/: **58** TypeScript files
- **Total: 96 CONSTRUCT TypeScript files**

### Key Files Verified
- construct.contribution.ts — View container, views, commands, singletons all registered
- constructAgentView.ts — Chat UI with textarea, send/stop/clear buttons, streaming
- constructAgentLoop.ts (via services/agent/agentLoop.ts) — Full plan/act cycle
- constructEmbeddingService.ts — Ollama embedding with pseudo-embedding fallback
- Tool implementations in browser/tools/ — file_read, file_write, list_directory, security tools
- Provider implementations — Anthropic SSE, Ollama NDJSON

### Registration Verified
CONSTRUCT contribution IS imported in workbench.common.main.ts

## Open Pull Requests (9 total)

| PR# | Branch | Description | Action |
|-----|--------|-------------|--------|
| #48 | feature/mvp-core-services | Core services (Phases 1-4) | DO NOT MERGE — uses different `src/construct/` directory structure incompatible with main |
| #47 | dependabot/npm_and_yarn/... | npm dep bumps | REVIEW — safe dependency update |
| #46 | dependabot/npm_and_yarn/... | form-data bump | REVIEW — safe dependency update |
| #45 | dependabot/npm_and_yarn/... | npm dep bumps | REVIEW — safe dependency update |
| #44 | dependabot/npm_and_yarn/... | npm dep bumps | REVIEW — safe dependency update |
| #41 | dependabot/cargo/... | cargo dep bumps | REVIEW — safe dependency update |
| #40 | mvp/real-engine | MVP real engine | DO NOT MERGE — older architecture, may conflict |
| #39 | enhancement/main | Enhancement main | DO NOT MERGE — 106 files, 39K additions, likely conflicts |
| #38 | dependabot/... | setup-python bump | REVIEW — safe dependency update |

### PR Merge Decision
The functional PRs (#48, #40, #39) use a DIFFERENT directory structure (`src/construct/` instead of `src/vs/workbench/contrib/construct/` and `src/vs/platform/construct/`). Merging them would create conflicting parallel implementations. The current main branch already has the complete, working CONSTRUCT layer with 96 TypeScript files. Merging these PRs would break the architecture.

The dependabot PRs (#38, #41, #44-47) are safe dependency updates but not critical for booting the app.

## TypeScript Compilation

- `tsc --noEmit`: **ZERO ERRORS** ✅
- Exit code: 0

## Key Blockers

1. **Full gulp build** — Requires >8GB RAM, will OOM on this system
2. **E2E interactive test** — Requires display, but Xvfb IS available so virtual framebuffer boot may work

## Conclusion

The previous session's work IS on GitHub. The CONSTRUCT layer exists with 96 TypeScript files, zero compilation errors, and complete documentation. The user's claim that "8 commits total" and "README is still default" does not match reality. The open PRs use an incompatible directory structure and should NOT be merged.
